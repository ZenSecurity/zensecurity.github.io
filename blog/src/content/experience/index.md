<div class="text-3xl w-full font-bold mb-5">Experience</div>

Been working in tech for 10+ years. Started with basic sysadmin stuff, got into security, ended up doing a bit of everything - from writing code to breaking it to helping teams build it right.

Currently working independently from Georgia with several clients. **Inspectorio** has been my main client since 2021, doing security architecture work for them.

Here's where I've worked before:
