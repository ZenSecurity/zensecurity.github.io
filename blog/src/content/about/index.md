<div class="text-3xl w-full font-bold mb-5">About Me</div>

<div class="mb-5">

I'm Mike, and I've been working in software and security for over 10 years. Currently based in **Tbilisi, Georgia**.

Started out doing system administration, moved into security testing, then spent years at companies like Wargaming and Inspectorio building secure systems. Now I work with various clients helping them with security problems, writing code, and fixing infrastructure.

### How I Work

I work with several clients - Inspectorio being the main one, plus various tech companies mostly in US and Europe.

The work varies - sometimes I'm writing code, sometimes doing security audits, sometimes just helping teams figure out their architecture. Check the [Services page](/services/) for details, but basically: if it involves code or security, I probably do it.

Everything's done by me personally - no team, no employees. Just simpler that way.

### What I'm Good At

**Security stuff:** I find vulnerabilities in web apps, APIs, cloud infrastructure. Do penetration testing. Help companies figure out if their setup is secure. Published a CVE ([CVE-2024-39887](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2024-39887/)) and active on [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/zen_security).

**Development:** Write code in Python, Go, JavaScript. Build backend systems, APIs, security tools. Work with AWS, GCP, Kubernetes - the usual cloud stuff.

**Teaching:** Run workshops on secure coding, help developers understand security. Good at explaining technical stuff to both engineers and management.

I compete in CTF competitions with the [ZenSecurity](https://ctftime.org/team/159174/) team - basically hacking challenges where you solve security puzzles. It's fun and keeps skills sharp.
