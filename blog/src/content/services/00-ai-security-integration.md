Help you integrate AI/LLM capabilities securely into your products. Make sure your AI features don't create new security problems. All work done personally.

### What I Do:
*   **Secure LLM integration** - Add GPT/Claude/other LLMs to your app without leaking data or creating vulnerabilities
*   **AI security reviews** - Check your AI features for prompt injection, data leakage, and other AI-specific risks
*   **RAG implementations** - Build retrieval systems that keep your data safe
*   **AI-powered security tools** - Use AI to find bugs, review code, analyze logs
*   **Security guardrails** - Set up proper input/output filtering and monitoring for AI features

**Common issues I help with:** Prompt injection attacks, PII leakage through AI, insecure API integrations, lack of rate limiting, missing content filters.

**How it works:** Can audit existing AI features, build new ones securely, or train your team on AI security best practices.
