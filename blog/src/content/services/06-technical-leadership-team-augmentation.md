I teach your team technical skills - security, cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes. All training done personally.

### What I Do:
*   **Security training** - Teach developers about secure coding and common vulnerabilities
*   **Workshops** - Hands-on sessions on penetration testing, DevSecOps, cloud security
*   **Kubernetes training** - Help your team learn Kubernetes properly
*   **Code reviews** - Review code with your team and explain security issues
*   **Mentorship** - One-on-one help for engineers learning security or infrastructure
*   **Process setup** - Help establish security processes and documentation

**How it works:** Can do workshops (half-day or full-day), ongoing training sessions, or one-on-one mentorship. Customize based on your team's needs.
