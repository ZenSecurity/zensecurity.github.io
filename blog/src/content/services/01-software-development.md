I write software with security built-in from the start. All work done personally.

### What I Do:
*   **Write secure code** - Following best practices to avoid common security bugs (OWASP Top 10)
*   **Code reviews** - Check your code for security problems and suggest fixes
*   **Build security features** - Login systems, user permissions, encryption, monitoring
*   **Fix vulnerabilities** - Find and fix security issues in existing code
*   **Train your developers** - Teach your team how to write secure code

**How it works:** I can work on your project, review code, or train your team. Flexible based on what you need.
