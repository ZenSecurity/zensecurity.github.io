I help secure your cloud infrastructure - AWS, GCP, Kubernetes. All work done personally.

### What I Do:
*   **Security audits** - Check your AWS/GCP/Kubernetes setup for security problems
*   **Kubernetes security** - Lock down your Kubernetes clusters properly
*   **Infrastructure code review** - Check your Terraform/CloudFormation for security issues
*   **Network security** - Set up firewalls, VPCs, security groups correctly
*   **Compliance** - Help you meet security standards (CIS, AWS best practices)
*   **Security tools** - Set up GuardDuty, Security Hub, monitoring

**How it works:** Can audit your current setup, fix security problems, or help set up new infrastructure securely.
