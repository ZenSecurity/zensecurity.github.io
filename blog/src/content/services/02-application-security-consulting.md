I help make your applications secure throughout the development process. All work done personally.

### What I Do:
*   **Security testing** - Set up automated security scans in your build pipeline
*   **Threat modeling** - Help you think through security risks before building features
*   **Code review** - Read your code to find security problems
*   **Architecture review** - Make sure your app design is secure
*   **DevSecOps setup** - Add security tools to your CI/CD pipeline
*   **Tool selection** - Help you pick and configure security tools

**How it works:** Can do one-time security assessments or ongoing work. I write reports explaining what I find and how to fix it.
