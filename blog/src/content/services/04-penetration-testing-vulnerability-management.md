I try to hack into your systems (with permission!) to find security problems. All testing done personally.

### What I Do:
*   **Web app testing** - Try to hack your website/application to find security bugs
*   **Network testing** - Check your network and servers for vulnerabilities
*   **Vulnerability scans** - Find security problems across all your systems
*   **Bug bounty help** - Set up and manage programs where hackers report bugs to you
*   **Fix guidance** - Show you exactly how to fix the problems I find
*   **Reports** - Written report with findings, evidence, and how to fix everything

**How it works:** Usually 1-2 week projects. I test your systems, find problems, write a report. Can do one-time tests or regular testing.
