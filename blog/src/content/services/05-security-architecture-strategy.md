I help plan and design security for your systems from the ground up. All work done personally.

### What I Do:
*   **Architecture design** - Plan how to build secure systems
*   **Security roadmap** - Create a plan for improving security over time
*   **Security controls** - Set up monitoring, logging, access controls, encryption
*   **Risk assessment** - Figure out what security risks you have
*   **Threat modeling** - Think through how attackers might target you
*   **Compliance help** - Prepare for security audits (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)
*   **Documentation** - Write security policies and procedures

**How it works:** Can help with strategy and planning, or hands-on implementation. Usually longer-term engagements.
